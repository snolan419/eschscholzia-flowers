## Dataset Summary 

This repository is the product of a research project investigating flower physiology in _Eschscholzia californica_ at Mount Diablo State Park. Each row in the petal dataset corresponds to a petal collected from an indiviudal plant in the field. Each row in the porometer dataset corresponds to a petal measurement with a LI-600 Porometer/Flourometer. This project is a work in progress, as I am currently in the process of collecting more data.

## Data Fields 

### petal.csv

**date:** string; the date the petal was collected and measured.

**week:** integer; the corresponding week in the fieldwork calendar.

**site:** string; the site designation from which the petal was collected. There are three Mount Diablo field sites: A, B, and C. Thus far, all data collection has commenced at site A.

**rep:** integer; the replicate within a given sampling week.

**plant:** string; an identification code used to specify an individual plant across different data files. 40 plants are sampled in a typical week, so in most cases a code designation is assigned between #1 - #40. Plants #1 - #20 represent the flower count sample, these code designations are fixed to the same individuals each week. Plants #21 - #40 represent the petal collection samples, these code designations are reassigned to a random sample of plants each week. The code designations match with the sample ID in the porometer dataset, and they will be used to append these data frames together at a future point. Less then 40 plants were sampled in weeks 1 through 3, therefore the code designations are irregular in these cases.

**p_freshMass:** float; petal fresh mass in milligrams (mg). This is the mass of the flower petal measured in the lab upon return from the field site. Petals were stored in plastic ziplock bags alongside a damp paper towel and transported in an icebox before measurement.

**p_surfaceArea:** float; petal surface area in centimeters (cm). Petals were scanned in a photocopy machine and measured with ImageJ.

**p_dryMass:** float; petal dry mass in milligrams (mg). Petals were dried in an oven at 70 degrees C for at least 48 hours.

**l_freshMass:** float; leaf fresh mass in milligrams (mg). Leaves were only collected in week 4, hence why all other data fields contain the character 'n' for none. On a given individual plant, each leaf was proximal to the flower the petal was sourced from.

**l_surfaceArea:** float; leaf surface area in centimeters (cm). Leaves were scanned in a photocopy machine and measured with ImageJ.

**l_dryMass:** float; leaf dry mass in milligrams (mg). Leaves were dried in an oven at 70 degrees C for at least 48 hours.

### porometer.csv

**Time:** string; a time stamp in Pacific Standard Time. Used in data quality control for the porometer measurements.

**Sample:** a sequential integer designation for the plant sampled with the porometer. Similar to the plant identification code, however it represents the number of plants sampled in a given week.

**Petal side:** string; indicates whether the porometer measurement represents the bottom (abraxial) petal surface or top (adaxial) petal surface.

**gsw:** float; surface conductance in moles per meter squared per second (mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>)

**leak_pct:** float; a measurement of leakage in the porometer gasket. Used in data quality control for the porometer measurements.

For descriptions of the other data columns, see petal.csv.
