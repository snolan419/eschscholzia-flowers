## Dataset Summary 

The dataset is comprised of direct transcriptions of the joke cards in Phyllis Diller’s gag file, which is part of the collections of the National Museum of American History (NMAH). Diller used a gag file to organize her material, which consisted of a steel cabinet with 48 drawers (along with a 3 drawer expansion) containing over 52,000 3-by-5 inch index cards, each holding a typewritten joke or gag. These index cards are organized alphabetically by subject, ranging from accessories to world affairs and covering almost everything in between. 
Each joke card generally features a category, author, date, and joke. All text is in English. The transcription process recorded the full contents of Diller’s gag file in a searchable dataset and was completed by Smithsonian Digital Volunteers in March 2017.
